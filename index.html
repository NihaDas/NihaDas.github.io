    	<p> Hi, I am Niha. 
I am a current freshman in Queens
 High School for Sciences at York 
College. My favourite subjects are
 science and math, especially 
geometry and biology, even though
 I hate blood and cutting up 
living things in general (I have 
no future as a doctor, not like 
I want to be one in the future). 
I like chemistry, though I <i> 
hate </i> physics. I also like 
history and I enjoy reading about
 ancient societies and cultures 
and generally critisizing their 
narrow view. My favorite topic 
to debate is female rights and 
democracy. I enjoy criticizing 
ancient civilizations who are 
dictator based or have limited 
women's rights. </p>

     <p>One of my favourite 
subjects is music, after 
chemistry of course, even though 
I once disliked the idea of 
taking music. My first music class
 consisted of me me screaming 
"Help!" and "I am so quitting 
tomorrow"(shivers) I am so 
quitting this tomorrow" 
internally. But I had an amazing 
teacher, who was extremely patient
 with me and all of the students 
who were new to music, and I can 
successfully add the title of 
"music-nerd" on my list of 
titles, even though my teacher 
laughs every time I metion this. 
I know a bunch about music, and 
I love ranting about how <i> 
terrible </i> modern classical 
music is, and how I wish they 
would die a horrible and painful 
death (Just listen to <a href="
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=
Pu371CDZ0ws"> Threnody for the 
victims of Hiroshima </a>). I also
 like to rant about the fact that
 Baroque composers didn't receive 
much recognition, how they were 
forgotten for <i> a complete 
century</i> even though Vivaldi 
(My favourite composer), Bach and
 other composers were pretty much
 geniuses, how Mozart died due to 
poverty and his grave has not yet
 been found, and he probably has 
the most written compositions in 
the least time. </p>

      <p> I also love drawing, 
even though it is pretty bad, oh 
who am I kidding, its terrible. 
But hey, it is enough to go by, 
and its the effort that counts, 
right. I have absolutely no hope 
in a competition, considering the 
fact that I failed in <i> every 
single art competition I entered. 
</i> Talk about bad art. I like to 
think my creative thinking during 
a project helps me get by a art 
project, not my actual artistic 
skills. But I can draw a circle 
pretty well. Just kidding, I 
mostly use a combination of 
creativity and my drawing abilities
 to make a project, and mostly 
score good grades. In one of my 
projects, I literally just put two 
colors, a yellow and red, and 
swirled them together with my 
brush, which, in the opinion of my 
classmates, was "amazing", even 
though to me, it was my worst one 
yet. Figures why people likes 
abstract art so much, while I 
like more realsitic paintings. 
I just have problem understanding 
abstract arts, which is so not my 
fault. </p>

      <p> I like English as well, 
but I take the books a bit too 
seriously, according to my friend. 
I spend the entire last week 
talking in Shakespearean, thinking 
"Hey, it's modern English, so why 
not!" until one of my friends 
helpfully told me that "No one 
talks in Shakespearean these days" 
and "People really won't 
understand you of you speak like 
that". Regardless to say, I was 
deflated by that (I had so much 
hope, oh tears). But I still apply 
Shakespearean words, ones which 
are normal, like "palpable, 
"pernicious", palpable being my 
favourite. After reading "The 
Time Machine", I spend a good 
amount of time pondering on how a 
line and point exists until I 
realized, hey, it's a fiction, 
it is not supposed to apply in 
real life. I tried to write books 
once, but I have no hope, as the 
nature itself was against me. 
After two cases of unsaved file, 
one case of copy pasting error 
and rereading one, thinking 
"this is so cringy", I decided on 
not writing books anymore, as it 
is not one of  my strengths. I try
 to write poems and songs, keyword 
'try', but mostly fail. </p>

      <p>I do many other things 
outside school. I sing, I play 
the violin (I learnt it this year)
, I am in Red Cross Club, Robotics;
 Team Cyber, a computer science 
club; American Chemical Society, 
a club for students who love 
chemistry; and Music Performance 
Club. I love volunteering and 
helping others out. I had a total 
of 30 hours of volunteering last 
year, minus the uncounted hours, 
which were a lot. I can't really 
tell the amount, as I spend almost
 every lunch period volunteering. 
I have stage anxieties, but I 
never allowed it to obstract me 
in anyway. I performed in my 
school talent show, multicultural 
show and Diversity. I am 
hardworking, and goal oriented. 
When I want to achieve a goal, I 
always try my best to reach it. I 
am a critical worker and overall a 
bit of a perfectionist. I always 
try to put my best effort in any 
work I do and try to make it as 
close to perfect as possible. </p>
